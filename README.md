# SnabbLerna Flow

Welcome to SnabbLerna Flow - your go-to UI library created with Snabbdom and Lerna! 🌟

This project aims to provide a seamless experience in developing UI components within a monorepo structure using Lerna. By leveraging the power of Snabbdom, we ensure efficient rendering and reactivity while adhering to proper coding standards. 🚀

## Functionality

### 1. Templating
Easily define your view templates using a method that accepts inputs like state and props, and returns a Virtual Node. This method is designed to be generic, allowing for versatile usage across different components.

### 2. Reactivity
Our library facilitates seamless state management with the `updateState` method. Modify the internal state of your application and watch as the view automatically updates to reflect these changes. Say goodbye to manual DOM manipulation - we handle event listeners directly using Snabbdom.

### 3. Life Cycle Events
Experience the convenience of life cycle events similar to React's `useEffect`. Detect when a component is mounted and execute functions accordingly. Stay in control of your application's life cycle effortlessly.
